## **Summary**
As an aspiring programmer with a passion for technology and problem-solving, I am eager to launch my career in the programming field. 

I do not possess any direct professional experience in programming, but as a person, who graduated from medical university, I am determit to learn and grow on a daily basis.

Furthermore, I am ready to dedicate significant time to self-study and online courses, expanding my skill set in web development, data structures, and software engineering. 

Although I may lack professional experience, I compensate with strong analytical and critical thinking skills, which enable me to dissect problems, identify patterns, and devise innovative solutions. I possess excellent attention to detail and thrive in environments that require meticulous programming practices.
